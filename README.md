Data used in the paper **"How to get closer to actual forest stand height using GEDI? A case study in central European Scots pine stands"**, authored by Wojciech Krawczyk and Piotr Wężyk, published in European Journal of Remote Sensing. 

The repository contains:
* [list](https://github.com/wkravchyk/EJRS-GEDI-accuracy/blob/main/GEDI_data_info.txt) of used GEDI (NASA) measurement files (L1B and L2A product),
* [list](https://github.com/wkravchyk/EJRS-GEDI-accuracy/blob/main/ALS_data_info.txt) of used ALS point clouds (GUGiK),
* [scripts](https://github.com/wkravchyk/EJRS-GEDI-accuracy/tree/main/scripts) used to process listed GEDI and ALS data written in R, as well as command lines used in gedisimulator software,
* [GeoPackage datasets](https://github.com/wkravchyk/EJRS-GEDI-accuracy/tree/main/data) which were the result of GEDI & ALS data processing,
* [figures](https://github.com/wkravchyk/EJRS-GEDI-accuracy/tree/main/figures) included in the parent journal paper.

Research was carried out and datasets were generated under the project “Active and passive satellite remote sensing technologies in forest change dynamics monitoring”, grant number 2023/49/N/NZ9/01917 funded by the National Science Centre, Poland.
